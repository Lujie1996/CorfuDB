/**
 * Defines the contract to follow by any event that can happened in the universe.

 * The universe event is the abstraction that allows to encapsulate different specific

 *      Management Tasks:
 *          - Remove Node
 *          - Add Node
 *          - Force Remove Node (hand of god)
 *      Data tasks:
 *          - Put Data (supported)
 *          - Get Data (supported)
 *      IT Tasks:
 *          - Kill Node
 *          - StopServerEvent Node (supported)
 *          - StartServerEvent Node (supported)
 *          - Disconnect Node (supported)
 *          - Reconnect Node (supported)
 *          - Pause Node
 *          - Resume Node
 *          - Wait for unresponsive nodes
